	     	In 2021, as a graduate student of IESEG Business School, we have observed that our classmates and family members are often troubled by how to acquire relevant skills quickly and accurately. Students will worry about how to learn practical skills that can support future careers, while friends or family will worry about how to cultivate interest and enrich their lives. So we have produced a website that integrates the advantages of various skills such as "my skills".
